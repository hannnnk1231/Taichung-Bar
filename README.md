# Taichung-Bar
## Introduction
Bar is getting popular in Taiwan nowadays since its chilling environment and more and more Taiwaneses enjoy having a glass of cocktail or beers after work or study. 
My friend is planning to open a bar at Taichung, Taiwan after ending his military service. He is wondering the best place to opening a bar reguarding to the customer types, the density of bars in Taichung and the venues around. My job is to find the best location for his bar.
